# Precision Measurement of the Mass of the Z Boson \\ with the ATLAS Open Data
The aim of the study was to investigate the relation between the accuracy and precision of the measurement of the invariant mass of the Z boson and variations in the magnetic field of the ATLAS detector. The ROOT Python 3.0 code can be found [here](https://github.com/EdvinSiewertson/Z_boson_ATLAS/blob/main/main.py).
